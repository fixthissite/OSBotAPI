{"name":"Lemons OSBot API","tagline":"\"lemons\" API","body":"##wtf is this?\r\nThis is my personal \"API\", or extension of OSBot's normal API. It has a few extra features, namely:\r\n\r\n- Web Walker\r\n- Advanced Interactions (wip)\r\n- Encourages reusable, configurable code\r\n- Helper functions to make life easier\r\n- No more filters, just Lambda goodness!\r\n\r\n##So, its just a few extra methods?\r\nNot at all, it restructures how your scripts are written without actually making it much different. For a hands-on guide, go to the \"So, how do I get started?\" section below. This section will talk about how scripts are structured.\r\n\r\nLets say you have a simple goblin killer script. At the moment it can find a goblin in the loaded region, then can interact with it. But, you want to add a few more features like Death Walk, Banking, and what not. Normally, you would just start writing some functions/cases/states/nodes/whatever in your script, and have those features. But what happens next time you need those features?\r\n\r\nThis API aims to solve this issue by introducing a \"Task\". The system somewhat resembles a \"Node\" setup, but with some improvements:\r\n\r\n- Tasks are actually mini-scripts, no need to do `script.getWhatever()`\r\n- Tasks can be grouped together to make ComplexTasks\r\n- Tasks can be given default conditions, and addition conditions can be added.\r\n\r\n##So, how do I get started?","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
